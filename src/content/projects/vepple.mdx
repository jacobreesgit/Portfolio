## Overview

Vepple is a virtual experience platform used by 30+ UK universities including Imperial College London, Nottingham Trent, and Queen's University Belfast. As Front-End Developer at Revolution Viewing, I've architected and shipped major platform features, resulting in 4x more pages viewed per session compared to standard university websites. Users now average 12+ pages and nearly 7 minutes per visit, with over 1 million students having interacted with the platform.

## Key Contributions

### Mobile Navigation Redesign

The original header-based navigation wasn't cutting it on mobile. I led a complete architecture overhaul, replacing it with a 3-tier footer navigation system (Explore, Maps, Events, Checklist, More). This involved engineering custom bottom sheet filter components and building TikTok-inspired session pages with smart caption truncation and landscape handling. The result: 85% increase in mobile engagement and 41% longer session duration.

### Events Management System

Universities needed a way to host hybrid virtual and on-campus open days. I architected a comprehensive events system with Firebase Firestore real-time chat, 1-second status updates, session scheduling with timezone-aware validation, itinerary management, and iCal export. The system supports session booking, live/scheduled/on-demand filtering, and map marker integration. This drove a 108% increase in views per session with users staying 3+ minutes longer on average.

### Explore by Map

Built interactive maps using Mapbox GL JS with directions API (walking, cycling, driving), location categorisation with grouped pins, points of interest overlays, and GPS-enabled tracking. Map users now average 21 pages per session, a 64% increase in engagement time compared to non-map users.

### A/B Testing Framework

Designed and implemented a production A/B testing framework supporting six UI variants with device/browser targeting, query parameter overrides for QA, and GTM data layer integration. Data-driven navigation pattern testing reduced bounce rate by 19%.

### Guided Tours

Enhanced the panorama viewer with dynamic zoom logic across nine aspect ratio categories. Built the Guided Tour suite featuring intro/end screens, autoplay with accessibility integration, mini-map navigation, progress tracking, and multi-CTA support. Over 1 million students have used Guided Tours, viewing 65% more pages per session.

### Accessibility Mode

Built a WCAG 2.2 AA compliant accessibility system: automatic background video pausing, transcript expansion for audio/video content, audio descriptions, and `prefers-reduced-motion` detection for automatic activation. Preferences persist via cookies/localStorage, with shareable accessible mode links via query parameters.

### Video Analytics

Engineered granular video engagement tracking capturing duration, watch progress, video type classification (intro/stop/outro), and exit reasons (navigated away/completed) with GTM data layer integration.
