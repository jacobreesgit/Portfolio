## Overview

Vepple is a virtual experience platform used by 30+ UK universities including Imperial College London, Nottingham Trent, and Queen's University Belfast. As Front-End Developer at Revolution Viewing, I've architected and shipped major platform features, resulting in 4x more pages viewed per session compared to standard university websites. Users now average 12+ pages and nearly 7 minutes per visit, with over 1 million students having interacted with the platform.

## Key Contributions

### Mobile Navigation

The original header-based navigation wasn't cutting it on mobile. I designed and built a completely new system from scratch: a fixed bottom tab bar with five contextual actions—Menu, Map, Personalise, Checklist, and Chat. Each tab opens custom swipeable bottom sheet panels built with [VueUse](https://vueuse.org), surfacing expanded navigation, Open Day schedule tracking, filter controls, and direct access to Explore by Map. The result: **85% increase** in mobile engagement and **41% longer** session duration.

### Events Management System

Universities needed a way to host hybrid virtual and on-campus open days. I architected a comprehensive events system with full calendar views (day/week/month), [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com) Firestore-backed personal agendas, real-time countdown timers, iCal export, and URL-persisted filters. Built TikTok-inspired session pages to cycle through open day talks with swipeable navigation. Integrated [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com) real-time chat alongside Q&A platforms like [Slido](https://www.slido.com) and [Chatify](https://chatify.com). This drove a **108% increase** in views per session with users staying **3+ minutes longer** on average.

### Explore by Map

Built interactive maps using [Mapbox GL JS](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-gljs) with custom 3D/2D controls, turn-by-turn directions (walking, cycling, driving), geolocation, location clustering with grouped pins, and fuzzy search. Map users now average **21 pages per session**, a **64% increase** in engagement time compared to non-map users.

### Guided Tours

Enhanced the Guided Tour suite built on [Pannellum](https://pannellum.org) for 360° panoramas, adding interactive hotspots, intro/end screens featuring ambassador videos with real-time captioning, mini-map navigation, and content spots embedding reels, galleries, and videos. Added dynamic FOV logic that adjusts zoom bounds based on panorama aspect ratio. Over **1 million students** have used Guided Tours, viewing **65% more pages** and staying **50% longer** per session.

### Home Screen Designs

Architected a modular home page system with four interchangeable designs, configurable via each client's dedicated [WordPress](https://wordpress.org) instance with [GraphQL](https://graphql.org). Variants include a typewriter animation with layered opacity, gesture-based filter panels with glassmorphism styling, and an embedded Guided Tour preview reusing the [Pannellum](https://pannellum.org) viewer and ambassador video captioning system mentioned above.

### Analytics and A/B Testing

Improved the [GTM](https://tagmanager.google.com) analytics infrastructure across the frontend and shared component library. Built a centralised data layer module to capture user interactions, enabling the marketing team to measure engagement with video content, interactive tours, and navigation flows.

Integrated [GrowthBook](https://www.growthbook.io) A/B testing for various experiments including home page variants and different UI approaches for guided tours, enabling data-driven design decisions.

### Accessibility Mode

Architected a comprehensive WCAG-compliant accessibility layer with centralised [Pinia](https://pinia.vuejs.org) state management. Supports OS preference detection and shareable accessible URLs via query parameters.

When enabled, accessibility mode activates global audio-described video track switching across embedded video platforms, auto-expanding transcripts, and 360° panorama motion suppression. Integrated [@vue-a11y/announcer](https://vue-a11y.com/announcer) for screen reader live region announcements, with a keyboard-navigable toggle, visible focus states, and analytics tracking.
