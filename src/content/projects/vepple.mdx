## Overview

Vepple is a virtual experience platform serving 30+ UK universities. As a Front-End Developer at Revolution Viewing, I led development of major features that transformed how universities engage prospective students through personalised virtual campus tours.

## Key Contributions

### Events Management System
Architected a comprehensive events system with Firebase Firestore real-time chat, 1-second status updates, session scheduling with timezone-aware validation, itinerary management, and iCal calendar export. Enabled universities to host hybrid virtual/on-campus open day events with session booking, live/scheduled/on-demand availability filtering, and map marker integration.

### A/B Testing Framework
Designed and implemented a production A/B testing framework with GDPR-compliant tracking and GTM data layer integration. Reduced bounce rate by 19% through data-driven navigation pattern testing.

### Mobile Navigation Overhaul
Led complete mobile navigation architecture redesign, replacing header with a 3-tier footer navigation system (Explore, Maps, Events, Checklist, More). Engineered custom bottom sheet filter components and TikTok-inspired session pages with caption truncation and landscape handling. Increased session duration by 41% and mobile engagement by 85%.

### Accessibility Mode
Built comprehensive WCAG-compliant accessibility system with automatic background video pausing, transcript expansion for audio/video content, audio descriptions, `prefers-reduced-motion` media query detection for automatic activation, and persistent preferences via cookies/localStorage.

### Custom Map UI
Developed interactive maps with Mapbox GL JS featuring custom directions API integration, session location markers, and map-based event filtering. Map users viewed 68% more pages than non-map users.

### Video Analytics
Engineered granular video engagement tracking system capturing duration, watch progress, video type classification, and exit reasons with GTM data layer integration for comprehensive analytics.

### Panorama & Guided Tours
Enhanced panorama viewer with dynamic zoom logic and responsive aspect ratio handling. Built Guided Tour suite with intro/end screens, autoplay with accessibility integration, mini-map toggle, progress tracking, and multi-CTA support.

## Impact Metrics

- 30+ UK universities using the platform
- 41% increase in session duration (mobile)
- 85% increase in mobile engagement
