## Overview

Vepple is a virtual experience platform used by 30+ UK universities including Imperial College London, Nottingham Trent, and Queen's University Belfast. As the sole front-end and UX developer at Revolution Viewing, I collaborate directly with the CTO and Product Manager on design and product direction, while also supporting customer success through client onboarding, demos, and feedback sessions. My work extends beyond typical frontend—I write GraphQL queries, build ACF blocks in WordPress, and implement features across the Vue.js/Quasar frontend. Insights from client interactions directly shape the features I build, from the mobile navigation overhaul to the events system. The platform has delivered 4x more pages viewed per session compared to standard university websites, with users averaging 12+ pages and nearly 7 minutes per visit. Over 1 million students have interacted with the platform.

## Key Contributions

### Mobile Navigation

The original header-based navigation wasn't cutting it on mobile. I designed and built a completely new system from scratch: a fixed bottom tab bar with five contextual actions—Menu, Map, Personalise, Checklist, and Chat. Each tab opens custom swipeable bottom sheet panels built with [VueUse](https://vueuse.org), surfacing expanded navigation, Open Day schedule tracking, filter controls, and direct access to Explore by Map. The result: **85% increase** in mobile engagement and **41% longer** session duration.

### Events Management System

Universities needed a way to host hybrid virtual and on-campus open days. I architected a comprehensive events system with full calendar views (day/week/month), [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com) Firestore-backed personal agendas, real-time countdown timers, iCal export, and URL-persisted filters. Built TikTok-inspired session pages to cycle through open day talks with swipeable navigation. Integrated [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com) real-time chat alongside Q&A platforms like [Slido](https://www.slido.com) and [Chatify](https://chatify.com). This drove a **108% increase** in views per session with users staying **3+ minutes longer** on average.

### Explore by Map

Built interactive maps using [Mapbox GL JS](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-gljs) with custom 3D/2D controls, turn-by-turn directions (walking, cycling, driving), geolocation, location clustering with grouped pins, and fuzzy search. Map users now average **21 pages per session**, a **64% increase** in engagement time compared to non-map users.

### Guided Tours

Enhanced the Guided Tour suite built on [Pannellum](https://pannellum.org) for 360° panoramas, adding interactive hotspots, intro/end screens featuring ambassador videos with real-time captioning, mini-map navigation, and content spots embedding reels, galleries, and videos. Added dynamic FOV logic that adjusts zoom bounds based on panorama aspect ratio. Over **1 million students** have used Guided Tours, viewing **65% more pages** and staying **50% longer** per session.

### Home Screen Designs

Architected a modular home page system with four interchangeable designs, configurable via each client's dedicated [WordPress](https://wordpress.org) instance with [GraphQL](https://graphql.org). Variants include a typewriter animation with layered opacity, gesture-based filter panels with glassmorphism styling, and an embedded Guided Tour preview reusing the [Pannellum](https://pannellum.org) viewer and ambassador video captioning system mentioned above.

### Analytics and A/B Testing

Improved the [GTM](https://tagmanager.google.com) analytics infrastructure across the frontend and shared component library. Built a centralised data layer module to capture user interactions, enabling the marketing team to measure engagement with video content, interactive tours, and navigation flows.

Integrated [GrowthBook](https://www.growthbook.io) A/B testing for various experiments including home page variants and different UI approaches for guided tours, enabling data-driven design decisions.

### Component Library

Built reusable content blocks for universities to customise their experiences, documented in [Histoire](https://histoire.dev) (Storybook for Vue). Blocks include carousels, video embeds, testimonials, and call-to-action sections that universities can configure via their CMS.

### Headless CMS Architecture

Developed custom [ACF](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com) blocks and [GraphQL](https://graphql.org) queries for the headless [WordPress](https://wordpress.org) CMS using [WPGraphQL](https://www.wpgraphql.com). Each university has a dedicated WordPress instance where content editors configure their experience, with the Vue.js frontend fetching content via GraphQL through [Stellate](https://stellate.co) CDN for edge caching. I write queries and mutations across both the CMS and frontend, ensuring performant content delivery and seamless editor workflows.

### Accessibility Mode

Architected a comprehensive WCAG-compliant accessibility layer with centralised [Pinia](https://pinia.vuejs.org) state management. Supports OS preference detection and shareable accessible URLs via query parameters.

When enabled, accessibility mode activates global audio-described video track switching across embedded video platforms, auto-expanding transcripts, and 360° panorama motion suppression. Integrated [@vue-a11y/announcer](https://vue-a11y.com/announcer) for screen reader live region announcements, with a keyboard-navigable toggle, visible focus states, and analytics tracking.
