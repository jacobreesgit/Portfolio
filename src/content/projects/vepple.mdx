## Overview

Vepple is a virtual experience platform used by 30+ UK universities including Imperial College London, Nottingham Trent, and Queen's University Belfast. As a Front-End Developer at Revolution Viewing, I led development of major features driving 4x more pages viewed per session compared to standard university websites, with users averaging 12+ pages and nearly 7 minutes per visit.

## Key Contributions

### Events Management System

Architected events system with Firebase Firestore real-time chat, 1-second status updates, session scheduling with timezone-aware validation, itinerary management, and iCal calendar export. Enabled universities to host hybrid virtual/on-campus open day events with session booking, live/scheduled/on-demand availability filtering, and map marker integration. Delivered 108% increase in views per session with 3+ minutes longer average engagement.

### A/B Testing Framework

Designed and implemented a production A/B testing framework with six UI variants, device/browser targeting, query parameter overrides, and GTM data layer integration. Reduced bounce rate by 19% through data-driven navigation pattern testing.

### Mobile Navigation Overhaul

Led complete mobile navigation architecture redesign, replacing header with a 3-tier footer navigation system (Explore, Maps, Events, Checklist, More). Engineered custom bottom sheet filter components and TikTok-inspired session pages with caption truncation and landscape handling. Increased session duration by 41% and mobile engagement by 85%.

### Accessibility Mode

Built WCAG 2.2 AA compliant accessibility system with automatic background video pausing, transcript expansion for audio/video content, audio descriptions, `prefers-reduced-motion` media query detection for automatic activation, and persistent preferences via cookies/localStorage. Added shareable accessible mode links via query parameters.

### Explore by Map

Developed interactive maps with Mapbox GL JS featuring directions API (walking, cycling, driving), location categorisation with grouped pins, points of interest, and GPS-enabled tracking. Map users averaged 21 pages per session with 64% increase in engagement time.

### Video Analytics

Engineered granular video engagement tracking capturing duration, watch progress, video type classification (intro/stop/outro), and exit reasons (navigated away/completed) with GTM data layer integration.

### Guided Tours

Enhanced panorama viewer with dynamic zoom logic across nine aspect ratio categories. Built Guided Tour suite with intro/end screens, autoplay with accessibility integration, mini-map navigation, progress tracking, and multi-CTA support. Over 1 million students have interacted with Guided Tours, viewing 65% more pages per session.
