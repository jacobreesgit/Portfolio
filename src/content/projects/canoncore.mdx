## Overview

I built CanonCore as a full-stack media library application that enables users to organise, browse, and stream their personal media collections. Built with Next.js 16, React 19, and PostgreSQL, it provides a cinematic interface for managing movies, TV shows, music, and other media.

## Key Features

### Hierarchical Organisation

Engineered drag-and-drop reordering system with dnd-kit supporting unlimited nesting depth, dual view modes (tree and grid), and optimistic UI updates.

### Media Streaming

Built video/audio streaming API with HTTP Range header support for seeking, subtitle rendering (SRT, VTT, ASS), and playback position persistence.

### Google Drive Integration

Architected OAuth 2.0 flow with AES-256-GCM encrypted token storage, bidirectional sync with circuit breaker pattern, and resumable uploads for large files.

### Polished Interface

Built a responsive dark-mode UI with hero banners, smooth transitions, and accessible components using Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui.

### Production Security

Implemented OWASP security headers (HSTS, CSP, X-Frame-Options), Redis rate limiting (Upstash), and input validation with Zod.

## Technical Highlights

- Developed test suite with 464+ unit tests, integration tests against real PostgreSQL, and Playwright E2E tests with Page Object Model
- Implemented structured logging with Pino including distributed request tracing via x-request-id headers
- Built authentication system with NextAuth.js v5 including email/password flow, password reset via Resend, and bcrypt hashing
- Created 20-page MDX documentation site with Fumadocs featuring collapsible navigation and dark mode support
