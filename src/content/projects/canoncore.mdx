## The Product

CanonCore turns Google Drive into a fully featured media library: visual browsing, metadata enrichment, progress tracking, and public sharing, without moving or duplicating your files. The name comes from "canon" - the app pulls canonical metadata from sources like [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org), with planned support for Fandom/MediaWiki and more. Create folder structures for movies and TV shows, reorganise with drag and drop, enrich items from [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org), track what you've watched, and share collections publicly. Your files live in your storage, not ours.

I use this daily for my own movie and TV library. Active development continues with a React Native iOS app and interactive 3D graph visualisation — see [In Progress](#in-progress) below.

    <div className="space-y-4">
      <div className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
        Two views: Grid is Netflix-style with poster cards and progress bars.
        Tree is file explorer-style showing all descendants at once. Every item
        page has a hero banner. Folders display watched and total counts using a
        90% completion threshold to account for credit skipping. "Go to next"
        performs a depth-first traversal to locate your first incomplete item
        automatically.

      <div className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
        Edit mode enables drag-and-drop, bulk selection, and full keyboard
        navigation with screen reader announcements. Pinned items (max 10)
        appear in the sidebar. [dnd-kit](https://dndkit.com) only loads in edit
        mode to keep browsing fast.

      Google Drive Sync
    </h3>
    <div className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
      All your media files stay in your Drive. Google's Changes API enables
      incremental syncs, fetching only changed items since the last update. If
      incremental sync returns no results, a verification step triggers a full
      sync. Conflicts are handled gracefully: if a file changed in Drive since
      your last sync, local changes are rejected with a notification. Errors are
      isolated per file.

      Forking
    </h3>
    <div className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
      Visibility inherits through the hierarchy—items can be public, private, or
      inherit from a parent. A public item with a private ancestor stays
      inaccessible. Other users can fork your collections into their own
      library, copying names, descriptions, artwork, and hierarchy. Media files
      and subtitles stay private. Think of it like sharing a Spotify playlist:
      the structure is public, the files aren't.

## In Progress

- **React Native iOS App** — A native iOS companion app built with React Native and Expo. Browse your library, stream media, and track progress on the go, sharing the same backend and authentication as the web app.
- **3D Graph Visualisation** — Interactive 3D graph visualisation built with Three.js, rendering items and connections as a force-directed node network with camera controls, zoom, and real-time physics.

---

## How It's Built

### Architecture Decisions

**Google Drive migration:** I originally built this on SFTP, but path-based matching meant every rename or move created duplicates. No stable IDs, no change detection API, read-only from the web. Google Drive solved all of it: permanent file IDs survive renames and moves, Changes API for incremental sync, full read/write access so users can create folders directly from CanonCore. Should have started here.

**Stack Auth → NextAuth.js v5:** I started with managed auth, then migrated to self-hosted JWT sessions after hitting rate limits. I added **15+ rate limiters** via [Upstash Redis](https://upstash.com) with different thresholds per action (strict for auth, generous for browsing).

---

### Security & Resilience

Circuit breaker on [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org) and Google Drive calls to handle failures gracefully. Edge-level bot protection blocks **35+ AI crawlers** while rate-limiting beneficial bots.

---

### Performance

Extracted a view-only Grid from SortableGrid to avoid [dnd-kit](https://dndkit.com) overhead in browse mode. Actions queue to IndexedDB when offline and replay on reconnect. Google Drive operations batched up to **100 per request**, reducing sync time from **~45s to ~3s**.

---

### Accessibility

WCAG 2.1 AA compliant throughout. Reduced motion support via a custom hook that disables carousel autoplay and animations. Skip link to main content. ARIA live regions for drag-and-drop announcements.

---

### Testing

**2,400+ tests** across unit, integration, and E2E layers. [Vitest](https://vitest.dev) unit tests cover auth, items, Google Drive sync, and crypto operations. Integration tests run against real PostgreSQL. E2E tests with [Playwright](https://playwright.dev) use the Page Object Model pattern and test against a real Google Drive account, not mocked. Tests automatically create missing fixtures for self-healing reliability.

---

### Observability

[Sentry](https://sentry.io) error tracking across client, server, and edge runtimes with source maps for readable stack traces. Layered error boundaries catch failures at each route scope and report to Sentry automatically. [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io) distributed tracing via Vercel's integration and Speed Insights for Core Web Vitals monitoring in production.

---

### CI/CD

GitHub Actions pipeline runs a quality gate (format, lint, type check, unused code detection) then kicks off tests and production build in parallel. [Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky) pre-commit hooks run ESLint and Prettier on staged files. Conventional commits enforced by commitlint.

---

### SEO & Social Sharing

Dynamic OpenGraph images generated server-side for every public profile and item page — shared links show rich preview cards on Twitter, Discord, and Slack. JSON-LD structured data (Movie, TVSeries, Person schemas) for search engines. Dynamic sitemap keeps all public profiles and items indexed.

---

### Component Documentation

All custom components are documented in [Storybook](https://canoncore-storybook.vercel.app).
