## Overview

Front-end development for a major UK footwear retailer with 160+ shops and an e-commerce platform serving millions of customers. Work spanned multiple brands in the group including Jones Bootmaker, with a focus on accessibility, performance, and creating tools that gave the content team more autonomy.

## Key Contributions

### Component Library

Built a WCAG 2.1 AA-compliant component library using [Shopify Liquid](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/liquid), [jQuery](https://jquery.com), and [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com). The library covered everything from product cards and navigation to promotional banners and checkout flows - **75+ reusable components** in total, documented with [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org). Hooking this up to [Sanity CMS](https://www.sanity.io) meant the content team could customise pages themselves. Rolled out across **5+ brands**.

### Search

Integrated [Algolia](https://www.algolia.com) InstantSearch to handle a catalogue of **10,000+ products**. Set up faceted filtering, typo tolerance, and synonyms, then configured relevance ranking to factor in popularity, stock levels, and margin. Added customised adverts throughout search results based on user context. Search-driven conversions went up **10%** after launch.

### Personalisation

This was a fun one - combined [Lucky Orange](https://www.luckyorange.com) session data with a weather API to serve location-aware product recommendations. The logic surfaced boots when it was cold or wet, sandals when warm. Simple concept, but it drove a **7%+ conversion lift** on those personalised recommendations.

### Testing

Set up a [Jest](https://jestjs.io) testing framework covering the critical paths: add-to-cart, checkout, search. Added snapshot testing to catch component regressions across the shared library. Took front-end test coverage up by **40%**, which made a noticeable dent in production bugs reaching checkout.
