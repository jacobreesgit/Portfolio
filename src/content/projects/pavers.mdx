## Overview

Front-end development for a major UK footwear retailer with 160+ physical stores and an e-commerce platform serving millions of customers. Work spanned multiple brands in the group including Jones Bootmaker and Herring Shoes, with a focus on accessibility, performance, and creating tools that gave the content team more autonomy.

## Key Contributions

### Component Library

Built a WCAG 2.1 AA-compliant component library using Shopify Liquid, jQuery, and Bootstrap. The library covered everything from product cards and navigation to promotional banners and checkout flows - around 200 reusable components in total. Hooking this up to Sanity CMS meant the content team could customise pages themselves without waiting on dev work. Rolled out across 5+ brands.

### Search

Integrated Algolia InstantSearch to handle a catalogue of 10,000+ products. Set up faceted filtering, typo tolerance, and synonyms, then configured relevance ranking to factor in popularity, stock levels, and margin. Search-driven conversions went up 10% after launch.

### Personalisation

This was a fun one - combined Lucky Orange session data with a weather API to serve location-aware product recommendations. The logic surfaced boots when it was cold or wet, sandals when warm. Simple concept, but it drove a 7%+ conversion lift on those personalised recommendations.

### Testing

Set up a Jest testing framework covering the critical paths: add-to-cart, checkout, search. Added snapshot testing to catch component regressions across the shared library. Took front-end test coverage up by 40%, which made a noticeable dent in production bugs reaching checkout.
