## Overview

As a Web Developer at Pavers, I built front-end solutions for a major UK footwear retailer with 160+ physical stores and an e-commerce platform serving millions of customers. My work focused on creating an accessible, performant shopping experience across multiple brands.

## Key Contributions

### Component Library
Developed a WCAG 2.1 AA-compliant component library using Shopify Liquid and jQuery with Bootstrap grid system. Built reusable components for product cards, navigation menus, promotional banners, and checkout flows. The library enabled content teams to customise pages via Sanity CMS headless architecture, deployed across 5+ brands including Jones Bootmaker and Herring Shoes.

### Search Enhancement
Integrated Algolia InstantSearch with faceted filtering, typo tolerance, and synonym handling. Configured relevance ranking based on popularity, stock levels, and margin. Drove a 10% increase in search-driven conversions.

### Personalisation Engine
Engineered location-based personalisation combining Lucky Orange session recordings with a weather API. Built recommendation logic showing weather-appropriate footwear (boots in cold/wet, sandals in warm) based on user's location. Achieved 7%+ conversion improvement on personalised recommendations.

### Testing Infrastructure
Increased front-end test coverage by 40% through Jest-based tests for critical user flows including add-to-cart, checkout, and search. Implemented snapshot testing for component regression prevention.
