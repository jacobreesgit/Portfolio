## Overview

I built MusicCount as a native iOS application that helps music enthusiasts keep their play count statistics accurate across their Apple Music library. It automatically discovers duplicate songs with mismatched play counts and provides tools to sync them.

## Key Features

### Library Browser
Built a full music library viewer using MusicKit API with play count display, supporting sort by title, artist, album, or play count with instant filtering.

### Smart Suggestions
Engineered duplicate detection algorithm that identifies songs with matching titles/artists but mismatched play counts across albums, compilations, and singles.

### Queue & Match
Developed queuing system allowing users to add songs multiple times to match play counts between different versions of the same track.

### Privacy First
Designed with complete on-device processing—no servers, no analytics, no data leaves the device.

## Technical Details

Built with SwiftUI using the Model-View architecture pattern (no ViewModels) with @Observable macro for reactive state management. Implemented Swift Concurrency throughout (async/await, actors, @MainActor isolation) for thread-safe code. Tested with Swift Testing framework using @Test macros and #expect assertions. Follows Apple Human Interface Guidelines with full Dynamic Type and VoiceOver accessibility support.
