## Overview

Waveger was my final year project at the University of Leeds, achieving a First class grade. I built a full-stack music chart prediction game that lets users predict which songs will chart each week, competing against friends on leaderboards.

## Key Features

### Real-Time Chart Data
Integrated 3+ external chart sources via Python Flask API, aggregating data from Spotify, Apple Music, and UK Official Charts.

### Firebase Backend
Implemented Firebase for real-time database, user authentication, and cloud functions.

### Prediction Engine
Built a points-based prediction system where users submit weekly predictions and earn points based on accuracy.

### Social Features
Developed leaderboards, friend comparisons, achievement badges, and weekly ranking notifications.

### Analytics Dashboard
Created personal statistics dashboard showing prediction history, accuracy trends, and performance metrics.

## Results

- Attracted 3,000+ user interest through market research and beta testing
- Generated 150,000+ views through targeted social media launch strategy
- Improved user satisfaction by 24% through iterative development based on user feedback surveys
- Achieved First class grade (70%+) for final coding project
